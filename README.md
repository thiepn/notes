# Notes

A local-first, zero-friction notes PWA designed to match Google Keep's capture speed while improving privacy, portability, recovery, search, and desktop ergonomics.

**Production target:** `https://thiepn.dev/notes/`

## Status

**P12 — Backup + Recovery is complete.** Notes now exports a versioned, self-contained full-library JSON backup of all seven database-v1 tables, validates graph integrity and attachment SHA-256 checksums before any restore write, downloads a current-device safety backup before destructive recovery, and replaces the whole local library atomically with IndexedDB rollback on failure.

**Next phase:** P13 — Google Keep Import.

## V1 scope

V1 includes:

- Text notes and checklists
- Auto-save
- Pinning, colors, labels, archive, and trash
- Grid and list views
- Fast local search
- Image attachments
- Revision history
- Backup and restore
- Markdown and JSON export
- Google Keep Takeout import
- Offline-first PWA installation
- Responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile UX

V1 explicitly excludes cloud sync, accounts, collaboration, AI, OCR, voice notes, drawings, nested folders, databases, project management, and plugin systems.

## Architecture

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- IndexedDB through Dexie
- Local-first data model
- Zod validation at data boundaries
- Repository-only write access for application features
- Optimistic per-note revision checks
- Transaction-safe multi-table operations
- Serialized text autosave with synchronous recovery journals
- Transactional checklist snapshot persistence with independent capture/editor recovery journals
- Normalized checklist item rows with stable IDs, ordering, check state, and parent relationships
- Bounded semantic per-note revision history with validated v1 snapshot payloads and 50-version pruning
- Transactional reversible history restore that preserves current lifecycle, labels, and attachments across text/checklist type changes
- Versioned seven-table full-library JSON backups taken from one consistent IndexedDB read transaction
- Base64 attachment preservation with independent SHA-256 backup integrity checks
- Read-only backup validation and recovery preview before any destructive database write
- Automatic current-device safety backup before full-library restore
- Atomic seven-table replacement recovery with IndexedDB rollback on write failure
- Accessible measured CSS Grid masonry with persistent list mode
- Existing-note editor with separate crash/reload recovery
- State-aware lifecycle actions with reversible Undo toasts
- Context-scoped card selection with modifier, range, explicit-control, and touch long-press entry
- Transactional bulk lifecycle/color/label mutations with field-scoped Undo snapshots
- Dependency-free in-memory search over a normalized IndexedDB-derived document index
- Accent-insensitive multilingual normalization with title/label/checklist/body relevance weighting
- Search filters and query operators for type, status, color, labels, dates, images, and links
- Searchable command palette with global navigation, creation, organization, view, appearance, and backup/recovery commands
- Real DOM card focus for J/K navigation and native Enter activation
- Shortcut safety guards for editable controls, composers, and modal dialogs
- Database-backed Notes, Archive, Trash, and Backup destinations with persisted primary navigation
- Case-insensitive normalized labels backed by a many-to-many `noteLabels` relationship table
- Persistent color and label organization with label-filtered views and automatic label inheritance during capture
- Tokenized responsive design system with light/dark/system appearance
- Vite PWA / service-worker layer
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for real-browser IndexedDB, capture recovery, card/grid, lifecycle, organization, checklist, selection/bulk, search, revision-history/recovery, backup/disaster-recovery, command/keyboard, responsive-shell, and end-to-end tests
- GitHub Actions for CI and deployment
- GitHub Pages-compatible build rooted at `/notes/`

## Principles

1. Capture is one interaction away.
2. Auto-save is the default; there is no save button.
3. Organization is optional; search, labels, colors, pins, archive, and trash stay shallow.
4. Local data integrity is release-critical.
5. The app remains usable offline and independent of any backend.
6. Every user should be able to export their data in open formats.
7. Advanced features never make basic capture slower.
