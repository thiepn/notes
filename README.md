# Notes

A local-first, zero-friction notes PWA designed to match Google Keep's capture speed while improving privacy, portability, recovery, search, and desktop ergonomics.

**Production target:** `https://thiepn.dev/notes/`

## Status

**P4 — Note Cards + Main Grid is complete.** Saved notes now use the permanent responsive card surface with measured Keep-style masonry, persistent grid/list modes, Pinned/Others grouping, theme-aware note colors, and an existing-note editor with serialized autosave and independent reload recovery.

**Next phase:** P5 — Note Lifecycle.

## V1 scope

V1 includes:

- Text notes and checklists
- Auto-save
- Pinning, colors, labels, archive, and trash
- Grid and list views
- Fast local search
- Image attachments
- Revision history
- Backup and restore
- Markdown and JSON export
- Google Keep Takeout import
- Offline-first PWA installation
- Responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile UX

V1 explicitly excludes cloud sync, accounts, collaboration, AI, OCR, voice notes, drawings, nested folders, databases, project management, and plugin systems.

## Architecture

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- IndexedDB through Dexie
- Local-first data model
- Zod validation at data boundaries
- Repository-only write access for application features
- Optimistic per-note revision checks
- Transaction-safe multi-table operations
- Serialized text autosave with synchronous recovery journals
- Accessible measured CSS Grid masonry with persistent list mode
- Existing-note editor with separate crash/reload recovery
- Tokenized responsive design system with light/dark/system appearance
- Vite PWA / service-worker layer
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for real-browser IndexedDB, capture recovery, card/grid, responsive-shell, and end-to-end tests
- GitHub Actions for CI and deployment
- GitHub Pages-compatible build rooted at `/notes/`

See [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md) for database invariants, [`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for the shell and styling contract, [`docs/CAPTURE.md`](docs/CAPTURE.md) for new-note capture and recovery, and [`docs/CARDS_AND_GRID.md`](docs/CARDS_AND_GRID.md) for the P4 card, masonry, list-view, and existing-note editing architecture.

## Principles

1. Capture is one interaction away.
2. Auto-save is the default; there is no save button.
3. Organization is optional; search, labels, colors, pins, archive, and trash stay shallow.
4. Local data integrity is release-critical.
5. The app remains usable offline and independent of any backend.
6. Every user should be able to export their data in open formats.
7. Advanced features never make basic capture slower.
