# Notes

A local-first, zero-friction notes PWA designed to match Google Keep's capture speed while improving privacy, portability, recovery, search, and desktop ergonomics.

**Production target:** `https://thiepn.dev/notes/`

## Status

Development is following the frozen phase plan. **P0 — Product Freeze + Repository Bootstrap** is in progress.

## V1 scope

V1 includes:

- Text notes and checklists
- Auto-save
- Pinning, colors, labels, archive, and trash
- Grid and list views
- Fast local search
- Image attachments
- Revision history
- Backup and restore
- Markdown and JSON export
- Google Keep Takeout import
- Offline-first PWA installation
- Responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile UX

V1 explicitly excludes cloud sync, accounts, collaboration, AI, OCR, voice notes, drawings, nested folders, databases, project management, and plugin systems.

## Architecture

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- IndexedDB through Dexie
- Local-first data model
- Zod validation at data boundaries
- Vite PWA / service-worker layer
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for end-to-end tests
- GitHub Actions for CI and deployment
- GitHub Pages-compatible build rooted at `/notes/`

## Principles

1. Capture is one interaction away.
2. Auto-save is the default; there is no save button.
3. Organization is optional; search, labels, colors, pins, archive, and trash stay shallow.
4. Local data integrity is release-critical.
5. The app remains usable offline and independent of any backend.
6. Every user should be able to export their data in open formats.
7. Advanced features never make basic capture slower.
